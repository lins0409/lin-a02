/*
*pseudo code
* Create a program to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for a person using the personâ€™s height in inches and weight in pounds. The program should prompt the user for weight and height.
*   -initialize scanner
*   -prompt for their height in inches and store the value
*   -prompt for their weight in pounds and store the value
*      -run the BMI calculator
*
*   BMI calculator function
*       -take in height and weight
*       -bmi = (weight / (height * weight)) * 703
*       -if it is between 18.5 and 25 display that they are a normal weight
*           -else, if they are less say that they are underweight
*           -if they are over say that they are overweight
*           -tell them to consult a doctor for either of those
